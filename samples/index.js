/* Where
One of the main tasks of a LINQ query is to restrict the results from a larger
collection based on some criteria. This is achieved using the Where operator,
which tests each element within a source collection and returns only those
elements that return a true result when tested against a given predicate
expression. A predicate is simply an expression that takes an element of the
same type of the items in the source collection and returns true or false.*/

/*Select
The process of transforming the results of a query is called projection.
You can project the results of a query after any filters have been applied 
to change the type of the collection that is returned. For example, you can 
select a single property or field from the source data or project multiple 
properties into an type. You can also add calculations and other 
operations to the projection to generate information that is based upon the 
source data but not directly retrieved from it.*/

/*Grouping
Grouping operators return collections of the source elements grouped by some algorithm.
This method provides the ability to organise information into groups.
you can specify a key based on the data held in a collection. The source data is then 
segregated into several enumerable lists, each containing all of the items with a matching key.
For example, you may group a collection of stock items by their categories. The result is a 
group of collections, one for each unique category, each containing all of the products in 
that category.
Grouping of data has many uses. You may decide to group a large data set and display one group 
at a time through the user interface. The user may be able to change the visible group using a 
combo box or selection of radio buttons. You may also group the information so that you can aggregate 
the data, obtaining sums, averages or other aggregations for each group.
